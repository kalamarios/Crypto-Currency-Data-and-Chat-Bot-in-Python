This is a team project for the 'Principles of Programming Languages and Compilers' class in Computer Engineering and Informatics Department @ UPatras. The whole project is built using Python. It uses web scraping techniques to import crypto currency data from an existing website, which are then analysed using pandas, giving various information about each coin to the user. An early version of a chatbot is also implemented, and all of the above are being presented and interacted with via a graphical interface that was created using tkinter.
